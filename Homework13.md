##Result
If the string is excited at 50% of string (Gaussian profile), the power spectra at different nodes are

They are power spectra at 5%, 10%, 40%, 50% of string, respectively. 
The power spectrum at 5% of string doesn't have 3000Hz component and the power spectrum at 10% of string doesn't have 1500Hz, 3000Hz components.(Though they are obvious) 

when the string is excited at 55%, even multiple of fundamental frequency components will also appear in its power spectrum:

If the string is excited at 25%, there won't exist "peak" at 600Hz, 1200Hz, 1800Hz, 2400Hz, 3000Hz, etc. in its spectra.
